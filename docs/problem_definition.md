# CyberClub Booking System

## 1. Problem Definition

Modern cyber clubs and gaming centers often rely on manual or semi-digital booking systems
such as phone calls, spreadsheets, or in-person reservations.  
This leads to several problems:

- Double bookings and scheduling conflicts
- Lack of real-time availability information
- Poor user experience for customers
- Difficulty managing peak hours and resources
- No centralized booking history or analytics

## 2. Project Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a **cross-platform booking application**
that allows users to:

- View available gaming stations in real time
- Book time slots in advance
- Authenticate securely using Firebase Authentication
- Store bookings and user data in a cloud database

The system aims to simplify cyber club operations and improve customer experience.

- User authentication (login / logout)

### Not included (for now):
